# LangaugeTransitionHelp

This will be a repo for mostly collections of fun ways to do tasks in Python and usage of different functions.
As I ponder around every now and then between Java and other languages, it takes time to google all these
everytime when I am back to Python again, so this will minimize some of that delay.
